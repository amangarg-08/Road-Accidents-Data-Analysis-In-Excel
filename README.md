# 🚨 Road Accidents Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📝 Project Overview
This dashboard provides insights into road accidents based on multiple factors such as **time, location, severity, weather, and road conditions**.  
The goal is to identify patterns, high-risk conditions, and accident hotspots to support **data-driven decisions for road safety improvements**.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 📈 Overall Accident & Casualty Trends
- Fatal Casualties: 7,135 (1.7%)  
- Serious Casualties: 59,312 (14.2%)  
- Slight Casualties: 351,436 (84.1%)  

### 📅 Yearly & Monthly Trends

### 🚗 Vehicle Type Impact
- Cars & goods vehicles: ~33K casualties each  
- Motorcycles: ~33.6K casualties → high vulnerability  
- Pedestrians: fewer in number but high severity risk  

### 🛣️ Road Conditions
- **Road Surface:** Dry roads dominate, wet/damp follow, icy/frosty less frequent but more dangerous  
- **Road Type:** Single carriageways (~310K casualties) are riskiest, dual (~67K) and roundabouts (~27K) safer  

### 🌍 Location
- Urban areas: 61% of casualties  
- Rural areas: 39%  

### 💡 Light Conditions

## 📝 Key Takeaways
1. Focus safety improvements on single carriageways  
2. Urban areas & daylight hours see the most accidents → linked to traffic density  
3. Motorcyclists disproportionately affected → stricter safety enforcement needed  
4. Casualty trends are stable year-on-year → indicates structural issues  
5. Most accidents occur in normal/dry conditions → driver behavior & congestion are bigger risks
